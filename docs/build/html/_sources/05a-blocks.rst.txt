  Blocks embed with the themes and blocks from the CMS with custom templates

  You may have noticed that there is no tons of block-type in the Supermint
  package and in the same time you have noticed that Supermint is the theme
  that contains the largest number of feature ... Where is the error?

  **That's simple:**

  Themes sold with ten blocks, once installed, just overload the sidebar until
  losing any legibility and fun to use, so With Supermint all generally
  available functionality through standard block are integrated with existing
  type-block via the Custom template or other system such as clips. Everything
  is easier and the race to the largest number of standard block becomes
  accidental.

  Many custom templates for many blocks are available with supermint. They allow
  to fully integrate the CMS functionality to Supermint and especially to enrich
  the display functionality. Available are templates for blocks such as page
  list, Autonav, Image block, Image slider, FAQ, ...
