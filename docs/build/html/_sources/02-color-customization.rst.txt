**Concrete5 has a theme customization built-in the core. This system is
powerful to personalize theme colors, it became a bit limited for other options
like toggle (on/off), Fonts (From Google fonts), Select options.**

In this case we choose to use this **theme customization** only for color
settings, others settings are available in the theme options section, in the
dashboard.



First of all, if you are not familiar with this system, `read this documentation <https://web.archive.org/web/20170101102058/https://www.concrete5.org/documentation/using-concrete5-7/in-page-editing/the-toolbar/page-edit-drop-down/design/>`_ .

Now it will be important to understand how Supermint are built for colors.

***********
Four colors
***********

Almost all colors from the theme are calculated from **four basic colors** :
Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary. If you play with these colors on the
left of this page you will see that lots of elements are changing. This is to
made your customization's life easier. Just change some colors and all the
website became yours!

**********************************
Need more controls? You have it!
**********************************

Some colors in the theme customization panel are transparent with a cross:

It's because this color are calculated or keep from one of **basic colors**.
