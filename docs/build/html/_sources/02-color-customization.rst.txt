Color Customization
###################
 Concrete5 has a theme customization built-in the core. This system is
 powerful to personalize theme colors, it became a bit limited for other
 options like toggle (on/off), Fonts (From Google fonts), Select options.

 In this case we choose to use this **theme customization** only for color
 settings, others settings are available in the theme options section, in the
 dashboard.

 First of all, if you are not familiar with this system, read this
 `documentation <https://documentation.concrete5.org/editors/in-page-editing/the-toolbar/page-edit-drop-down/design>`_ .

 Almost all colors from the theme are calculated from **four basic colors** :
 Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary. If you play with these colors on the
 left of this page you will see that lots of elements are changing. This is to
 made your customization's life easier. Just change some colors and all the
 website becomes yours!
