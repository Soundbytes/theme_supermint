The choice of presets available is displayed on the top left, in each page of
options. When you save a page of options, they will only be saved in the preset
THAT displayed on the top left. 

**Manage Presets**

On the Theme presets page, you can create, duplicate, delete, rename, export
presets. The page is intuitive just try. 

**Apply presets to pages**

Sometimes we need a site that some pages have different appearance. For this we
can create different preset, set one for the whole site and apply another
certain pages. 


* To set a preset for the **whole site**, just click on the button
  "Set as Default".
* To apply a preset on a **page only**, go to the property page and set the
  attribute **Supermint Preset Option**.
