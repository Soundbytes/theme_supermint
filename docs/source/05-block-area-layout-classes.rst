*******************
Class and templates
*******************
Concrete5 has developed tools to customize the content of a three-level
different page. It can take some time for the taming but once acquired, these
tools become very powerful aids to create a visually and content-rich page.


*************************
Three levels, two fashion
*************************
Depending on the design or functionality to the content we will add a class on
the block, on the area or on a Layout and then change the template for the
block or layout.

  Custom template or class ?::

      Block: templates and classes
      Areas: Only classes
      Layout: templates and classes

In general (not all the time), **areas classes** are larger than the **block
class**, classes of Areas rather act on the design while blocks of classes
rather act on a feature of the block, much like an option complementary.
These are general rules because of block classes sometimes are design classes.

How to use
----------

.. index:: Classes; Block

Block classes & templates
-------------------------

Once added a block on a page you can click on it and select the **Design &
Custom Template** menu item. Then in the top bar click the gear, it will show
the selection panel classes and templates. Click in the class and you will see
a list, make your choice. **Several classes are selectable**.

.. index:: Classes; Area

Area classes
------------
Click on an empty area or its label at the bottom left of it and select the
**Edit Area Design** menu item. In the top bar click the gear, it will show the
choice of class pane. Click in the class and you will see a list, make your
choice. **Several classes are selectable**.

.. index:: Classes; Layout

Layout class
------------
Finally you can add templates from Concrete5 and classes to Layouts. To do
this, add a layout by clicking on an empty area or its label and choose
**Add Layout**. Once added, click the label of one of these columns
(Column 1 Column 2, ...) and choose **Edit Layout Design**. In the top bar
click the gear, it will show the selection panel classes and templates. Click
in the class and you will see a list, make your choice. Several classes are
selectable.

Which class/templates ?
-----------------------
Now that you know how to apply a template or class on three levels, get
acquainted with those available with Supermint.

* For a list of **classes** and **templates** for the **block**
  `in the block section <./05a-blocks.html>`_ of this site.



* For a list of classes for Areas it's in the
  Feature section> Page & miscellaneous>
  `Area classes <./06-area-classes.html>`_

* And finally you will find nothing yet on layouts because the feature is so
  new, I did not even study the subject. But beware, it could be very powerful.
